# Initios Frontend

###Â Developing
Go to the generator folder and exec the following command:

```javascript
npm link
```

Yeoman will now recognize the package, just run yo initios-frontend
from another folder and you can test this generator on local.

Workaround: If "npm link" is not working for you try with

```javascript
npm link generator-initios-yeoman
```
